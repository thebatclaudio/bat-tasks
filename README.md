## Bat Tasks

This is an example project created for my speech "PEST - Bring back the joy of testing in PHP" @ Tech & Beer #2 - 31 May 2023.

This is a fictional Batman management software API used to organize vigilantes tasks. 

The purpose of this project is to show how to simply integrate PEST into Laravel and enjoy its simplicity.
